# My tmux config

Requires version 1.6 or later. I recommend installing with [homebrew][brew].

    brew install tmux

I manage my dotfiles using [homesick][hs].

    homesick clone jlmaccal/tmux_config
    homesick symlink jlmaccal/tmux_config

Actually, it is probably better if you fork the repo and work with your own
copy.
